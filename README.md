# REDCAPP 
# REanalysis Downscaling Cold Air Pooling Parameterization

# Introduction
REDCAPP is a python-based open source software for parameterizing the temporal and spatial differentiation of surface effects and cold air pooling when downscaling reanalysis data in mountainous areas.

REDCAPP can produce daily, high-resolution gridded fields of near-surface air temperature in mountains through providing a number of tools for

(1) downloading and manipulation of ERA-Interim data saved as netCDF4;

(2) contucting the interpoaltion of 2-meter air temperature and pressure level temperatures (or upper-air temperature);

(3) deriving proxy of land-surface effects from reanalysis data;

(4) addressing the spatially varying land-surface effects based on fine-scale DEM.

# How to run

(1) Please download the codes as well as the munuscript (PLEASE ADD LINK HERE);

(2) read "HOW TO RUN THIS" for each example;

(3) run the example scripts by using the data attached.
