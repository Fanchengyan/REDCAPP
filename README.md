# REDCAPP 
# REanalysis Downscaling Cold Air Pooling Parameterization

# What is REDCAPP
REDCAPP is a python-based open source software for parameterizing the temporal and spatial differentiation of surface effects and cold air pooling when downscaling reanalysis data in mountainous areas. REDCAPP can produce daily, high-resolution gridded fields of near-surface air temperature in mountains.

# Why REDCAPP is powerful 
REDCAPP simulates high-resolution near-surface air temperaure well through providing a number of tools for

(1) downloading and manipulation of ERA-Interim data saved as netCDF4;

(2) contucting the interpoaltion of 2-meter air temperature and pressure level temperatures (or upper-air temperature);

(3) deriving proxy of land-surface effects from reanalysis data;

(4) addressing the spatially varying land-surface effects based on fine-scale DEM;


Additionally, the input data are not limited to ERA-Interim and could be extended to other reanalyses such as CFST, NCEP, MERRA or 20CRV2.

# How to run REDCAPP
REDCAPP is wrotten by python (version 2.7) and public open. To run the software, please

(1) download the codes as well as the munuscript (PLEASE ADD LINK HERE);

(2) read "HOW TO RUN THIS" for each example;

(3) directly run the example scripts by using the data attached or revise the script as wanted.
